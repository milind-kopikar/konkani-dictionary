# Amchigale Konkani Dictionary - Development Roadmap

## Current Status âœ…
- **649 entries** successfully imported with proper UTF-8 encoding
- **Working frontend** with search functionality
- **PostgreSQL database** with hybrid indexing (B-tree + GIN)
- **Express API** with multiple search endpoints
- **Clean data** with malformed entries removed

## Phase 1: Data Completeness (High Priority) ðŸ”¥
**Goal:** Import remaining ~3,700 entries from CSV
**Timeline:** 1-2 days
**Tasks:**
1. Debug CSV import failures around row 3756
2. Implement better error handling for malformed rows
3. Add data validation and cleaning during import
4. Verify all entries have proper Unicode encoding

**Benefits:**
- Complete dictionary content (4,000+ entries vs current 649)
- Better search results and coverage
- Foundation for all other features

## Phase 2: Public Deployment (Medium Priority) ðŸš€
**Goal:** Make dictionary publicly accessible
**Timeline:** 2-3 days
**Tasks:**
1. Deploy to Railway/Render with PostgreSQL
2. Update milind-kopikar.github.io to include dictionary
3. Set up environment variables and production config
4. Implement basic analytics

**Benefits:**
- Public access for Konkani language preservation
- Real user feedback
- Platform for community contributions

## Phase 3: User Contributions & Updates (Medium Priority) ðŸ‘¥
**Goal:** Allow community to improve dictionary
**Timeline:** 3-4 days
**Tasks:**
1. Add "Suggest Correction" feature for each entry
2. Implement admin review system
3. Add new word submission form
4. Create moderation dashboard

**Benefits:**
- Crowdsourced improvements
- Community engagement
- Living, growing dictionary

## Phase 4: AI/Vector Integration (Lower Priority) ðŸ¤–
**Goal:** Enhanced search and AI features
**Timeline:** 5-7 days
**Tasks:**
1. Implement vector embeddings for semantic search
2. Add LLM integration for translation assistance
3. Create context-aware search
4. Add pronunciation guides

**Benefits:**
- Better search relevance
- AI-powered language learning
- Advanced linguistic features

## Immediate Next Action Recommendation ðŸŽ¯

**Start with Phase 1: Fix CSV Import**
- You have 649/4,000+ entries working
- Missing data significantly impacts dictionary value
- Other phases depend on complete data
- Relatively quick win (1-2 days vs weeks for AI features)

Would you like me to:
1. **Debug the CSV import** to get all your data in?
2. **Set up deployment** to make it public first?
3. **Work on user contribution features**?
4. **Explore vector database integration**?
