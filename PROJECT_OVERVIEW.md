# 🌟 **Amchigale Konkani Language Preservation Platform - Project Summary**

## 📖 **Background & Vision**

### **The Challenge**
**Amchigale Konkani** is a critically endangered dialect spoken by ~2 million people along Karnataka's west coast. Unlike Goan Konkani (which has Google Translate support), Amchigale Konkani has:
- ❌ No digital presence or AI support
- ❌ No standardized script (uses Kannada/Devanagari)
- ❌ No comprehensive dictionaries or learning materials
- ❌ Declining usage among younger generations

### **The Opportunity**
With modern AI (LLMs, speech-to-text, OCR), we can digitally preserve and revive this language. Success here creates a **replicable framework** for endangered languages worldwide.

### **Linguistic Advantages**
- 📚 **Sanskrit roots**: Significant vocabulary overlap
- 🔗 **Familiar grammar**: Similar to Hindi/Marathi/Kannada structure
- 🎯 **AI-friendly**: Can leverage existing Indo-Aryan language models

### **Detailed Background Context**
Amchigale Konkani, a dialect of Konkani spoken by approximately 2 million people along the west coast of Karnataka, is at risk of extinction. Unlike Goan Konkani, which has a digital presence and is supported by Google Translate, Amchigale Konkani has no such resources. One of the key challenges is that Amchigale Konkani lacks its own script and is traditionally written using either Kannada or Devanagari (Marathi) script.

However, Amchigale Konkani (hereafter simply called Konkani) follows the same grammatical structure as other Indian languages like Hindi and Marathi. It also has words that are derived from Sanskrit. We could potentially use this to our benefit to recreate sentences in Konkani.

Since the language is not well-documented or widely available on the internet, its usage is declining with each generation. There are no comprehensive dictionaries, grammar references, or structured learning materials, making it difficult for younger generations to learn and use the language.

With advancements in AI—specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), speech-to-text, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)—we now have an opportunity to digitize and preserve Amchigale Konkani. By creating a digital corpus of Konkani words, equivalent meanings in English, Marathi and Hindi, and sentences, we can digitize the language aiding in its revival and preserving the rich cultural heritage of those who speak and write in Konkani.

The importance of language preservation extends beyond Konkani. Many indigenous languages around the world face similar challenges. If we successfully develop a framework to revive Konkani using AI, the same approach can be applied to other endangered languages.

## 🎯 **Project Goals & Problem Statement**

The goal of this initiative is to create:

### **Phase 1: Dictionary Platform** *(Current Focus)*
**(a) Amchigale Konkani dictionary** by having others contribute Konkani words written in English and Devanagari along with their meaning in English, featuring:
- Konkani words (English alphabet + Devanagari script)
- English meanings and context sentences
- Expert validation workflow via WhatsApp
- Multi-dialect support (geographic variations)

### **Phase 2: Language Model (LLM)**
**(b) Create a Language Model (LLM)** for Amchigale Konkani using:
- Dictionary corpus
- OCR-digitized books (~100 pages)
- Expert-validated phrases
- Sanskrit/Marathi transfer learning

### **Phase 3: Speech Technology**
**(c) Create a Speech to Text and Text to Speech** version of Konkani:
- ~100 hours YouTube audio (needs Konkani-aware transcription)
- Expert pronunciation recordings
- Audio validation workflow

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Current Foundation** *(Already Built)*
- ✅ **React Website**: Professional site with chatbot at `milind-kopikar.github.io`
- ✅ **Node.js Backend**: Multi-LLM chatbot API on Railway/Render
- ✅ **Database Design**: Comprehensive PostgreSQL + Vector DB architecture

### **Dictionary Platform Components**
```
Frontend (React - extends existing site):
├── KonkaniDictionary page → Main dictionary interface
├── SearchBar → Multi-script search (English/Devanagari)
├── ContributionForm → Expert word submission
├── AudioPlayer → Pronunciation playback
└── ValidationDashboard → Expert review workflow

Backend (Node.js - extends existing chatbot):
├── /api/dictionary → CRUD operations
├── /api/search → Semantic + text search
├── /api/validation → Expert approval workflow
├── /api/audio → Voice recording/playback
└── /api/whatsapp → Expert notification system

Database Layer:
├── PostgreSQL → Structured word data + expert management
├── Vector DB (Qdrant) → Semantic search capabilities
└── Cloud Storage → Audio recordings
```

### **Expert Validation Workflow**
```
1. Expert submits word via web form
2. System sends WhatsApp notification to regional validators
3. Senior experts review and approve/reject
4. Validated entries go live in dictionary
5. Regional variations tracked separately
```

## 📊 **Available Resources & Constraints**

### **Limited Digital Resources**
- **Printed text**: Some Konkani is available in printed text, written in Devanagari script. We were able to use a combination of OCR and LLM to digitize about 100 pages of written Konkani. Since these were scanned pages that were digitized, and since LLMs do not understand Konkani inherently, some of these transcriptions may not be completely accurate.
- **Dictionary data**: About 2000 Konkani words written either in Devnagiri or English has been captured along with their meanings in English or Marathi. This has been done via crowdsourcing from expert humans who speak Konkani.

### **Human Expertise Available**
A group of fluent Konkani speakers is willing to contribute by writing Konkani words into English or and Devangiri and then writing the English meaning. They can also write entire phrases. We would like to use this for the dictionary as well as to feed words to the language model.

### **Potential Audio Resources**
There are 100 hours of spoken Konkani content on YouTube, which could be converted into text using speech-to-text AI. However, since no existing Konkani language model exists, it is unclear how accurately AI can transcribe spoken Konkani words into Devanagari script. The limited attempts we made with existing multi-modal LLMs found that the LLM was transcribing the spoken Konkani word into the nearest Marathi or Hindi word.

### **Linguistic Structure Considerations**
- Konkani shares a significant vocabulary overlap with Sanskrit
- Its grammar and syntax are structurally similar to Marathi, Hindi, and Kannada, which could aid in developing an AI model
- There are a few books written that teach Konkani to beginners. We could potentially use these books to train LLM on how to use Konkani.

### **Technical Infrastructure**
- 🌐 **Deployment**: GitHub Pages + Railway/Render
- 🤖 **AI Backend**: Multi-provider LLM system (OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic)
- 💾 **Database**: PostgreSQL + Vector search ready
- ☁️ **Cloud Path**: Migration plan to Google Cloud Platform

2. **Week 3-4**: Expert contribution forms + validation workflow  
3. **Week 5-6**: Audio integration + WhatsApp notifications

### **Phase 2: AI Enhancement** *(Weeks 7-12)*
4. **Semantic search**: Vector embeddings for meaning-based lookup
5. **LLM integration**: Konkani-aware chatbot responses
6. **Transfer learning**: Leverage Hindi/Marathi models

### **Phase 3: Speech Pipeline** *(Weeks 13-20)*
7. **ASR training**: Expert pronunciation recordings
8. **YouTube processing**: Konkani-aware transcription
9. **TTS development**: Text-to-speech generation
